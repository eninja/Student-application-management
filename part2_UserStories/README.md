# User stories
A list of the most important stories / functionalities that we want to implement in the system.

As a (user), I want (function), so that (value)


## As a admission officer, I want
*  to have an access to officer panel, so that I could view all applicants in a table form and easily sort and filter them
*  to have an easy way to edit fields of the form, so that I could choose which fields are required to be filled before student can submit application
* to be able to change status of application manually, so I could

## As a student, I want
*  to be able to search through the website, so that I could find content I need easier and faster
*  to be able to edit my profile, so it will be updated
*  to be able to specify priorities of the programs, so that I could apply to multiple and still be accepted to the one that is the most important to me
* to be reminded (mail, SMS, platform) about any deadlines for programs I subscribed to or started submission for, so I didn't miss anything important
* my work gets auto saved after every few seconds, so I didn't lose any data due to error with platform or my mistake

## As a admin, I want
* to have an access to admin panel, so that I could manually create, view and update users, information, roles, sections, programs, enrollments
* system-wide access to the UID, groups, courses, sections, so that I could manually resolve the issues
* to send announcements to users of the system so they can be informed (about issues or scheduled maintenance events)
* to monitor resource consumption (CPU, bandwidth I/O, data base I/O, etc.), so that I could ascertain the health of the system and its resources
* to monitor user activity (active users, http requests, sessions open, etc.), so that I could assess system performance based on demand
