# User stories
A list of the most important stories / functionalities that we want to implement in the system.

As a (user), I want (function), so that (value)


## As a admission officer, I want
*  to have an access to officer panel, so I could view of applicants in table form and easy sort and filter them
*  to have easy way to edit fields of form, so I can choose which will be required to fill before student can submit application
* to be able to change status of application manually, so I can

## As a student, I want
*  to be able to search through website so that I can find content I need easier and faster
*  to be able to edit my profile, so it will be updated
*  to able to specify priorities of courses, so I can apply to multiple of them and still be accepted on which one is the most important for me
* to be reminded (mail, SMS, platform) about any deadlines for course I subscribed or started submission for, so I didn't miss anything important
* my work get auto saved after every few seconds, so I didn't lose any data with error with platform or my mistake

## As a admin, I want

* system-wide access to UID, groups, courses, sections, so I can manually resolve issues

* to monitor resource consumption (CPU, bandwidth I/O, data base I/O, etc.), so I can ascertain health of the system and it's resources
